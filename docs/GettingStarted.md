# Getting Started with `cppproptest`

## Running your first property-based test

`cppproptest` requires [CMake](https://cmake.org) for build tool.
You can examine the requirements with:

```Shell
# at cppproptest root directory
$ cmake . -BBUILD
$ cd BUILD && make && ./test_proptest
```

You can edit your project's CMakeLists.txt to include the library `proptest`:

```CMake
ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(<path_to_cppproptest_root>)

```

And then add this library to `TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES` section.

```
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES( ...
    ...
    proptest
    ...
)
```

Here's an example using [Googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest):

```cpp
// ...
#include "proptest/proptest.hpp"

using namespace proptest;

TEST(AudioCodec, EncoderDecoder)
{
    // ASSERT_FOR_ALL() is shorthand for ASSERT_TRUE(forAll(...))
    ASSERT_FOR_ALL([](SoundData soundData) {
        auto encoded = MyAudioCodec::encode(soundData);
        auto decoded = MyAudioCodec::decode(encoded);
        PROP_ASSERT_EQ(decoded, soundData);
    });
}
```

Note that `ASSERT_FOR_ALL` is a simple macro wrapping an `ASSERT_TRUE` google test macro around the `proptest::forAll` function. You can find more information in [Using Assertion](#using-assertions) section.

## What you can do with `cppproptest`

Here's the list of property-based test functions (with namespace `proptest`) you can use in `cppproptest`:

| Name                                    | Description                                       | Remark                                      |
| :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------ |
| `property()`                            | Define a property                                 | Returns a `proptest::Property` Object       |
| `forAll()`                              | Define and run a property                         | Shorthand for `property(callable).forAll()` |
| `matrix()`                              | Define and run a matrix test                      | Shorthand for `property(callable).matrix()` |
| `Property::forAll()`                    | Run the property with random inputs               | Requires generators (defined or supplied)   |
| `Property::matrix()`                    | Run the property with cartesian product of inputs | Input list as `initializer_list`            |
| `Property::example()`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Run the property with specific inputs             |                                             |
| `EXPECT_FOR_ALL()`                      | Run `forAll` with `EXPECT_TRUE` Google Test macro | Shorthand for `EXPECT_TRUE(forAll(...))`    |
| `ASSERT_FOR_ALL()`                      | Run `forAll` with `ASSERT_TRUE` Google Test macro | Shorthand for `ASSERT_TRUE(forAll(...))`    |

You can define a property with a criteria function and certain input domain. You can choose to verify the criteria function with randomly generated inputs (`forAll()`) or with manually specified ones (`example()`). You can also exhaustively test all combinations of inputs based on the values you provided (`matrix`).
You can wrap arround a property test with Google Tests' macro so that you make Google Test consider the property test failure as a test failure (otherwise, the property test will only print the failure information to standard output and return false.).

## Defining and running a `property` test

`property()` defines a property with optional configurations. By calling `property()`, you are creating a `Property` object. `forAll()` is the shorthand for calling `Property`'s method `forAll()`. `Property::forAll()` performs property-based test using supplied callable (function, functor, or lambda). While `forAll()` would work most of the time, `property()` in combination with its methods `.forAll()`, `.example()`, `.matrix()` can be more versatile and configurable at times.

```cpp
forAll([](int a, int b) -> bool {
    return a + b == b + a;
});
```

is equivalent to:

```cpp
property([](int a, int b) -> bool {
    return a + b == b + a;
}).forAll();
```

### Defining a Property

Defining a property requires a callable. For example, a lambda as following is such a callable with an `int` as parameter:

```cpp
[](int a) -> bool {
    return a >= 0;
}
```

Arguments are generated automatically by the library and the return value of the function will indicate success(`true`) or failure(`false`) of the property.
Asserts can also be used to mark successes and failures. If you prefer not to use boolean return value to indicate success/fail, you can use void return type and use assertions instead:

```cpp
[](int a) {
    PROP_ASSERT_GE(a, 0);
}
```

### Generators and Arbitraries under the hood

In above case, the function is called with an integer argument randomly generated by the test library. The library will repeatedly feed in some random values into the function for given number of runs.

Under the hood, the library requires a generator for each of given parameter types. For each parameter, either an `Arbi<T>` (an arbitrary, the default generator for type `T`) should be defined ahead, or a custom generator must be provided. In above example, a predefined generator `Arbi<int>` is used to generate an integer argument.

You can provide a custom generator as additional argument(s) to `property()` function, as following:

```cpp
property([](int a, int b) -> bool {
    return true;
}, myIntGenerator);
```

Any remaining parameter in the property function with no custom generator supplied will be generated using an arbitrary. In above example, `int a` is generated using `myIntGenerator` as it was supplied in the arguments, while `int b` will be generated using `Arbi<int>`, as no custom generator was supplied. If there is no arbitrary defined for a type and no custom generator is supplied either, a compile error will be emitted, as the library cannot test a property without a generator for the input type.

Many primitive types and standard containers have their default generators `Arbi<T>` defined by the library for convenience.
You can find more about generators and see the full list of built-in Arbitraries in [Generators](Generators.md) page.


## Testing a Property

Once a property has been defined, you can run a simple randomized test based on the defined property with `Property::forAll()`.

```cpp

auto prop = property([](int a, int b) -> bool {
    return true;
}, myIntGenerator);

prop.forAll();
```

It will repeatedly call the lambda with different input combinations of `a` and `b` then stops after some designated number of runs or a time duration. If a property fails with an input combination by the lambda returning `false` or encountering an assertion failure, the test stops there and the library will provide some information on the failed case. If possible the library will simplify the failed case with a process called **shrinking**. See [Shrinking](Shrinking.md) page for more information on this process.

#### Specifying generators with `Property::forAll()`

While you can define a property with or without speciying generators, you can additionally specify or override some of the generators when calling `.forAll()`, by passing the generators as arguments.

```cpp
// a is fixed to INT_MAX, while b is randomly generated
prop.forAll(just<int>(INT_MIN));

// specifying generator for both a and b
prop.forAll(just<int>(INT_MIN), inRange<int>(-100, 100));
```

In above example, `proptest::just()` is a [generator combinator](Combinators.md) that simply keeps generating a single value. `proptest::inRange` is another example of generator combinator. It generates a numeric value within a given range.

#### Specifying example inputs with `Property::example()`

While having a randomized set of inputs is powerful, you might want to test the property with specific combination of inputs to ensure those combinations are always tested. This can be accomplished using `.example(...)`. You need to specify all the parameters needed to call the callable:

```cpp
// define a property
auto prop = property([](int a, int b) -> bool {
    return a + b == b + a;
});

// check specific examples
prop.example(INT_MIN, INT_MIN);
prop.example(INT_MIN, INT_MAX);
prop.example(INT_MAX, INT_MIN);
prop.example(INT_MAX, INT_MAX);
```


#### Specifying full matrix of inputs with `Property::matrix()`

While `.example()` provides a way to test certain examples by specifying each one of them, you might want to go even further to test all combinations of concerned inputs (e.g. all defined enum values) by taking a cartesian product of the input parameters. In above example,taking `{INT_MIN, INT_MAX}` for `a` and another `{INT_MIN, INT_MAX}` for `b` and multiply them as if it was a matrix multiplication. This will result in four combinations `{(INT_MIN, INT_MIN), (INT_MIN, INT_MAX), (INT_MAX, INT_MIN), (INT_MAX, INT_MAX)}`. `.matrix()` lets you do exactly this kind of combination test:

```cpp
// equivalent to above using four `prop.example()`
prop.matrix({INT_MIN, INT_MAX}, {INT_MIN, INT_MAX});
// arbitrary size of the list can be used
prop.matrix({INT_MIN, 0, INT_MAX}, {INT_MIN, 0, 1, INT_MAX});
```


## Configuring test runs

#### Setting number of runs

You can set the number of runs with `Property::setNumRuns(int num)`. The default number of runs is `1000`.

```cpp
auto prop = property([](int a, int b) -> bool {
    // ...
});
prop.setNumRuns(100).forAll();
```

You can set default number of runs affected globally by calling the static method `PropertyBase::setDefaultNumRuns(int num)`. Subsequent properties will follow this number of runs unless specified with `setNumRuns()`.

```cpp
PropertyBase::setDefaultNumRuns(100);
```

#### Setting the random seed

A property can be configured a specific random seed. This can be done by calling `Property::setSeed(unsigned long seed)`.

```cpp
auto prop = property([](int a, int b) -> bool {
    // ...
});
prop.setSeed(savedSeed).forAll();
```

If no random seed is specified, current timestamp in milliseconds is used. You can override these unspecified random seeds globally with an environment variable `PROPTEST_SEED`. This comes in handy when you have encountered a failure and its random seed value is available for reproduction:

```Shell
# ... failed test with random seed 15665312
$ PROPTEST_SEED=15665312 ./my_proptest
```

#### Setting maximum test duration

You can set maximum duration for a property test run by calling `Property::setMaxDurationMs()`. This will limit the time regardless of number of runs. It can be useful if your time resource is limited or if you have some external timeout duration configured.

```cpp
prop.setMaxDurationMs(60000); // will run the test for maximum of 60 seconds, if number of runs does not run out first.
```

#### Chaining configurations

You can chain the configurations for a property as following, for ease of use:

```cpp
auto prop = property([](int a, int b) -> bool {
    // ...
});
prop.setSeed(savedSeed).setNumRuns(1000000).setMaxDurationMs(60000).forAll();
```


## Using Assertions

`cppproptest` provides assertion(fatal)/expection(non-fatal) macros based on the popular [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) library.

```cpp
// PROP_EXPECT*: non-fatal, continues upon failure
PROP_EXPECT(condition);
PROP_EXPECT_TRUE(condition);
PROP_EXPECT_FALSE(condition);
PROP_EXPECT_EQ(A, B);
PROP_EXPECT_NE(A, B);
PROP_EXPECT_LT(A, B);
PROP_EXPECT_GT(A, B);
PROP_EXPECT_LE(A, B);
PROP_EXPECT_GE(A, B);
PROP_EXPECT_STREQ(A, B, N);

// PROP_ASSERT*: fatal, breaks test upon failure
PROP_ASSERT(condition);
PROP_ASSERT_TRUE(condition);
PROP_ASSERT_FALSE(condition);
PROP_ASSERT_EQ(A, B);
PROP_ASSERT_NE(A, B);
PROP_ASSERT_LT(A, B);
PROP_ASSERT_GT(A, B);
PROP_ASSERT_LE(A, B);
PROP_ASSERT_GE(A, B);
PROP_ASSERT_STREQ(A, B, N);
```

Also, there are [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) compatible macros for `forAll` that fails the gtest test case or suite upon a property test failure (since with a bare `forAll`, the failures won't behave as gtest failure):

```cpp
EXPECT_FOR_ALL(...); // non-fatal, shorthand for EXPECT_TRUE(proptest::forAll(...));
ASSERT_FOR_ALL(...); // fatal, shorthand for ASSERT_TRUE(proptest::forAll(...));
```
